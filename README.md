# RawSound (Pre-Alpha, barely functional at this time)
Like my 3rd attempt at making a DAW.<br>
This time I started with a synthetizer plugin instead of the interface.<br>
Originally, I wanted to keep the design as bare as possible so I dont get distracted and focus on the logic instead of spending hours designing the thing.<br>
Guess what, I got distracted, spent hours on the design and the logic sucks.<br>
